# Project-Dark-Forest
## Introduction
### A project to imitate the conflicts between civilizations.
There are three different kinds of civilizations, their attitudes to aliens are neutrality, friendly, and aggressively.

Each civilization has its technology points, which will increase randomly by years.

Technology points will decide the observing range of civilization and the result of the war between civilizations.

A civilization can also get technology points by allying with or destroy other civilizations.

>1. Friendly civilizations will try to ally with all the civilizations that they know.

>2. Neutrally civilizations won't attack others unless they are attacked. And they are willing to allying with friendly civilizations.

>3. Aggressively civilizations will attack all the civilizations that they've already know. 

For every war, the civilization which has fewer technology points will be destroyed.
